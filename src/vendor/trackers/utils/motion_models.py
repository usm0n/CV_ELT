"""Build Kalman predict matrices (``F`` and ``Q``) for bbox trackers.

``KalmanFilter`` only runs the predict math (``x = F @ x``, etc.). This module
sets ``F`` and ``Q`` on the filter before each step.

``Q`` is *process noise*: extra uncertainty added on each predict — how much
the box is allowed to drift when there is no new detection. Each tracklet sets
``Q`` in ``_configure_noise()``.
Those values assume **one frame** between updates. ``frame_step=1.0`` is
that case; other values rescale ``F`` and ``Q`` for shorter or longer gaps.

``Q`` uses the standard constant-velocity + white-noise-acceleration (DWNA)
layout for gaps (``frame_step > 1``) and shorter-than-nominal steps
(``frame_step < 1``): velocity variance scales as ``Δt²``, position as ``Δt⁴``.
At a *near-nominal* ``frame_step`` — within a tolerance band of ``1.0`` — the
original configured Q (set by ``_configure_noise`` via ``set_kf_covariances``)
is returned unchanged. This preserves the hand-tuned per-tracker noise, keeps
backward compatibility when ``timestamp`` is omitted, and makes a timestamped
stream at its nominal FPS behave like the fixed-rate one: ``frame_step`` is a
product of a subtraction, so it lands near ``1.0`` without ever hitting it. The
band's half-width is time-based (``_NOMINAL_FRAME_STEP_TOLERANCE_SECONDS *
frame_rate``) so it stays fps-invariant; callers that do not supply a frame
rate fall back to the fixed frame-unit band ``_NOMINAL_FRAME_STEP_TOLERANCE``.
Same block structure as ``filterpy.common.discrete_white_noise`` — see the
filterpy docs or source if you want the formulas side by side.

        Within a near-nominal band of ``1.0`` the step counts as one nominal
        frame and the configured Q (``baseline_Q``) is returned unchanged,
        preserving hand-tuned noise. Outside that band the step is a real gap
        and the DWNA formula is applied via ``_dwna``.

        The band is what makes dynamic-rate mode line up with fixed-rate mode.
        ``frame_step`` comes from ``(t - t_prev) * frame_rate``, so a stream at
        its nominal FPS lands *near* ``1.0``, never on it; an exact comparison
        would send every such step down the gap path, where ``_dwna`` rebuilds Q
        from the velocity diagonal alone and drops the configured position noise.

        The band half-width adapts to ``frame_rate`` so it stays fps-invariant.
        The physical error a nominal stream carries (ms-clock rounding, capture
        jitter) is bounded in *wall-clock seconds*, but expressed in *frame
        units* it grows with FPS, so a fixed frame-unit band would break at high
        FPS. Multiplying a seconds budget by ``frame_rate`` makes the error and
        the band scale together:

        - ``frame_rate`` given (the normal tracker path):
          ``tolerance = _NOMINAL_FRAME_STEP_TOLERANCE_SECONDS * frame_rate`` —
          4 ms of wall-clock slack at any FPS.
        - ``frame_rate`` absent (e.g. OC-SORT ORU sub-steps, which are frame-unit
          replay steps): the fixed fallback ``_NOMINAL_FRAME_STEP_TOLERANCE``
          (0.1 frame units), whose own ~50 FPS ceiling is documented on that
          constant.

        The band is symmetric in ``frame_step``, but the DWNA growth it forgoes
        is not: treating ``1.0 + tol`` as nominal skips ``(1 + tol)**4``
        position-variance growth while ``1.0 - tol`` skips ``(1 - tol)**4``
        shrink, so the upper edge is marginally worse-behaved than the lower —
        immaterial this close to ``1.0``.

        What this does **not** cover: capture jitter wider than the tolerance
        still takes the gap path, and lost-track pruning remains asymmetric
        between the two modes (dynamic-rate mode drops time-expired tracks
        before association, while fixed-rate mode enforces its frame budget
        after association), so the two modes can still differ by one
        ``lost_track_buffer`` frame.

            frame_step: Elapsed time in frame units; a value within the
