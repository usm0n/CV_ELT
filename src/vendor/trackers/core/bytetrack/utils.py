    Remove dead or immature lost tracklets and return alive trackers
    that are within the time/frame budget AND (mature OR just updated).

    Note:
        Maturity is sticky: once a tracklet has reached
        `minimum_consecutive_frames` consecutive observations it is
        assigned a non-negative `tracker_id` (i.e. `tracker_id != -1`)
        and stays "confirmed" through subsequent missed frames until
        pruned. This matches the original ByteTrack paper's "confirmed
        track" semantics. For unconfirmed tracks (`tracker_id == -1`),
        maturity is determined by `number_of_successful_consecutive_updates`;
        this counter is reset to 0 in `predict()` on any missed frame.

    Args:
        tracklets: List of BaseTracklet objects.
        minimum_consecutive_frames: Number of consecutive frames an object
            must be tracked before it is considered a valid track.
        maximum_frames_without_update: Frame-count budget (used when
            ``maximum_time_without_update`` is ``None``).
        maximum_time_without_update: Seconds budget. When provided, this
            criterion is used **instead of** the frame-count budget, enabling
            correct pruning under variable frame rates.

    Returns:
        List of alive tracklets.
