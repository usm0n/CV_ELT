class ByteTrackTracker(BaseTracker):
    """ByteTrack operates online by processing all detector outputs, categorizing them
    by confidence thresholds to enable a two-stage association process. High-score boxes
    are initially linked to tracklets via Kalman filter predictions and IoU-based
    Hungarian matching, optionally enhanced with appearance features. Low-score boxes
    follow in a secondary matching phase using pure motion similarity to revive occluded
    tracks. Tracks without matches are kept briefly for potential re-association,
    preventing premature termination. This inclusive approach addresses common pitfalls
    in detection filtering, establishing ByteTrack as a flexible enhancer for existing
    tracking frameworks.

    ByteTrack excels in dense environments, where its low-score recovery mechanism
    minimizes missed detections and enhances overall trajectory completeness. It
    consistently improves performance across diverse datasets, demonstrating robustness
    and generalization. The tracker's speed remains competitive, facilitating
    integration into production pipelines. On the downside, it is highly dependent on
    detector quality, with performance drops in noisy or low-resolution inputs.
    Additionally, the motion-only secondary association may lead to erroneous matches
    in scenes with similar moving objects.

    Note:
        When input detections carry no confidence (`detections.confidence is
        None`), ByteTrack falls back to a single-stage IoU match equivalent to
        SORT — every detection is treated as fully confident, so the
        low-confidence recovery stage is bypassed. Pass per-detection
        confidences to exercise the two-stage matching this class otherwise
        provides.

    Args:
        lost_track_buffer: Non-negative `int` specifying number of 30 FPS frames
            to buffer when a track is lost. `0` deletes a confirmed track on the
            first missed frame. Increasing this value enhances occlusion
            handling but may increase ID switching for disappearing objects.
        frame_rate: `float` specifying video frame rate in frames per second.
            Must be positive. Used to scale the lost track buffer for consistent
            tracking across different frame rates.
        track_activation_threshold: `float` specifying minimum detection
            confidence to create new tracks. Higher values reduce false
            positives but may miss low-confidence objects.
        minimum_consecutive_frames: `int` specifying number of consecutive
            frames before a track is considered valid. Before reaching this
            threshold, tracks are assigned `tracker_id` of `-1`.
        minimum_iou_threshold: `float` specifying IoU threshold for associating
            detections to existing tracks. Higher values require more overlap.
        high_conf_det_threshold: `float` specifying threshold for separating
            high and low confidence detections in the two-stage association.
        state_estimator_class: State estimator class to use for Kalman filter.
            Defaults to `XYXYStateEstimator`. Can also use
            `XCYCSRStateEstimator` for center-based representation.
        iou: IoU similarity metric instance to use for data association.
            Defaults to standard `IoU`. Can be replaced with any `BaseIoU`
            subclass (e.g. GIoU, DIoU, CIoU) to change how bounding-box
            similarity is computed during the association step.
            Passing ``None`` (the default) is equivalent to ``IoU()`` and is
            provided for backward compatibility with existing code that did not
            supply an ``iou`` argument.
