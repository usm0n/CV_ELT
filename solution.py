solution.py — the ONLY file a team has to implement.

    detect_events(video_path)  -> [[start_sec, end_sec, label], ...]    # Part A
    RiskEstimator().reset(meta); .step(frame, t_sec) -> float           # Part B (optional)

Keep the names and signatures exactly as they are. Everything else — models,
tracking, rules, helper modules under src/ — is up to you.

Labels must come from CLASSES. You may REMOVE classes you never predict;
do not add new ids.

        first frame) and ``label in CLASSES``. Return ``[]`` if nothing
        happened. Segments of the same class must not overlap.

    A typical pipeline:
        1. sample frames (every 2nd–5th frame is usually enough),
        2. detect road users (YOLO / RT-DETR) and track them (ByteTrack),
        3. turn trajectories + scene layout (lanes, stop line, crossing)
           into per-frame flags for each class,
        4. merge consecutive flags into segments, drop blips < 0.5 s,
           merge gaps < 1 s,
        5. optionally re-score `accident` / `near_miss` candidates with a
           learned clip classifier.
